bind9stats.py
version 0.20

A munin plugin to obtain data from a BIND9 statistics server, written
in Python. Tested with BIND 9.10's statistics server exporting version
3 of the statistics. In earlier versions of BIND 9.9, the v3 schema of
statistics can be specified using the 'newstats' configuration directive.
The newstats option was introduced in BIND 9.9.3.

If you are using older versions of BIND 9.9 that only support version 
2  of the XML statistics, you'll need to use the 0.1x version of this 
program, which can be obtained from: 

   https://github.com/shuque/bind9stats/archive/v0.12.tar.gz

Software needed to use this:
* Python 2.7 or later (should work with Python 3, but I haven't 
  tested it extensively)
* BIND: BIND DNS server from isc.org. https://www.isc.org/software/bind
* Munin: a resource monitoring tool that does pretty graphs.
       See http://munin-monitoring.org/ for details.)

Some notes:
* BIND can be configured to provide per-zone query statistics also. This
  plugin currently doesn't process that data, and only does the aggregate
  statistics for the entire server.
* Only the _default view is used. Servers configured to use multiple
  views that want per view statistics will have to extend this program
  a bit.

Instructions for using this:
- Have a DNS server running BIND9, with the statistics server enabled.

  On my BIND servers, I usually have something like the following in the
  configuration file:

        statistics-channels {
                inet 127.0.0.1 port 8053 allow { 127.0.0.1; };
        };

- Have a munin-node running on it, install bind9stats.py in its plugins
  directory and restart the node.
  You can also run the plugin on another machine, if the statistics
  server allows queries remotely. Set the HOST and PORT environment
  variables appropriately in that case before invoking bind9stats.py.
