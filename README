bind9stats.py

A munin plugin to obtain data from a BIND9 statistics server, written
in Python. Tested with BIND 9.9's statistics server.

Software needed to use this:
BIND: BIND DNS server from isc.org. https://www.isc.org/software/bind
Munin: a resource monitoring tool that does pretty graphs.
       See http://munin-monitoring.org/ for details.)

This is roughly based on the perl plugin by George Kargiotakis,
described here:
http://www.void.gr/kargig/blog/2012/08/30/bind9-statistics-channels-munin-plugin/

Some differences:
* Adds the DNS Opcodes statistics.
* Adds Zone maintenance statistics.
* Displays the view-specific statistics properly (currently only the
  _default view is queried). The perl plugin wasn't obtaining the view 
  specific stats properly, at least on my BIND 9.9 servers, apparently 
  because of some XML schema changes.
* Doesn't include graphs for memory and tasks. I might add those later.

Instructions for using this:
- Have a DNS server running BIND9, with the statistics server enabled.
- Have a munin-node running on it, install bind9stats.py in its plugins
  directory and restart the node.
  You can also run the plugin on another machine, if the statistics
  server allows queries remotely. Set the HOST and PORT environment
  variables appropriately in that case before invoking bind9stats.py.
